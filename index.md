## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is my first time creating github website. It is interesting to learn the new functionlities of Github other than just version control and code collaboration. 
you can check my Git repositories at [here.](https://github.com/parulJain30)

#### Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-data science] GitHub with its URL and describe its potential applications and values.
Ans:  I find Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to be a very useful one stop place of dataset which makes it the most popular forum among the data scientists and machine learning enthusiast. Kaggle not only provides datasets but also allows to publish your own dataset. The solution, code and approach of other data scientists is accessible to everyone signed up on kaggle. It hosts challenges and also has many learning articles for people interested in machine learning and data science. You can work with thousands of data scientist across the globe. Also, it maintains your rank which can increase the value of your resume.


#### Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.
Ans:  I am interested in the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng available on coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).  I am intrigued by the Machine learning algorithms and always wanted to learn the practical implementation of various models and understand how to choose the best performing model for any scenario. This course covers exactly what I wish to work in professional front. Some of the topics include Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, best practices in Machine learning and AI and their implementation in case-studies. 
Finally, the course also covers the innovation and best practices in Silicon valley pertaining to machine learning and AI.
